-- Postgres initialization script
-- This script runs automatically when the database container is first created
--
-- Note: The database is automatically created by Postgres using the POSTGRES_DB
-- environment variable. All schema creation is handled by Alembic migrations
-- which run automatically via the backend docker-entrypoint.sh script.
